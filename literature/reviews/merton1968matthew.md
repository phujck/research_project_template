# Abstract
Describes the social dynamics of credit in science, where eminent scientists receive disproportionate credit for contributions. Introduces "obliteration by incorporation"—the process where ideas become so obvious/canonical that their origins and costs are forgotten.

# Key Findings
- **Obliteration by Incorporation (OBI)**: The "manufacturing of obviousness" at a social level.
- **Canonization**: Standard tools stop being cited as they become "obvious."

# Role in "Obviousness Trap"
Justifies the **"Social Shadow"** of the trap. Representations are social toolkits that hide their own history of manufacture. OBI is the end-state of manufacturing obviousness.
