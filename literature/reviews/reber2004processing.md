# Abstract
This paper explores how the ease of processing (fluency) acts as a hedonic cue. It argues that high fluency is experienced as positive affect, which is then used as a heuristic for various judgments, including truth and beauty.

# Key Findings
- **Fluency as Signal**: Success in processing a stimulus creates a "fluency signal."
- **Misattribution**: Agents misattribute this signal of internal ease to external properties of the object (like truth or reliability).

# Methodology
Review of psychological experiments on perceptual and conceptual fluency.

# Role in "Obviousness Trap"
Legitimises **Obviousness as a cost signal**. It provides the psychological mechanism for why $1/C_{cons}$ "feels" true. Fluency is the subjective corollary to low construction cost.
