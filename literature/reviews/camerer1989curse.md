# Abstract
Demonstrates that better-informed agents find it difficult to reconstruct the mindset of less-informed agents. Knowledge creates a "curse" where the easier a claim is to the expert, the more they underestimate its difficulty for the novice.

# Key Findings
- **Retrospective Bias**: Experts cannot effectively ignore their knowledge when predicting the judgments of others.
- **Fluency Leak**: The ease of current representation distorts the estimate of past labor.

# Methodology
Market experiments and probability judgments.

# Role in "Obviousness Trap"
Justifies the **"Fluency leaks backward in time"** claim. It explains why fields misremember the cost of manufacturing obviousness and why credit is misallocated once a basis becomes standard.
