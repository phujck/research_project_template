# Abstract
This paper formalizes the idea that human attention is a limited resource. Using information-theoretic constraints (Shannon capacity), it shows that agents will "rationally" ignore certain types of information if the cost of processing it exceeds the marginal utility.

# Key Findings
- **Information Bottleneck**: Agents act as if they are passing the state of the world through a noisy channel with limited capacity.
- **Selective Verification**: The "Budget Rule" emerged here: agents allocate bits to high-variance or high-frequency events that impact utility most, leaving "tails" unverified if capacity is full.

# Methodology
Information-theoretic optimization. Maximize $U$ subject to $I(S; \hat{S}) \leq K$.

# Role in "Obviousness Trap"
Legitimizes the **Budget Rule**. Bounded verification is the *optimal* response to capacity constraints. Obviousness (high fluency) is the signal that the "channel" is already optimized for this claim, incentivizing zero further budget allocation.
