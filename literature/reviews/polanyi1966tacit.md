# Abstract
Classic philosophical work arguing that "we know more than we can tell." It introduces the concept of tacit knowledge—the underlying structure of skills and tools that are so internalized they become invisible to the user.

# Key Findings
- **Proximal vs Distal Termini**: We attend *from* our tools *to* the task.
- **Toolkit Invisibility**: The more a representation is mastered, the more it disappears from conscious awareness.

# Role in "Obviousness Trap"
Supports the claim that **representations/toolkits are manufactured to minimize conscious friction**. A perfect representation is one that the agent can ignore while using it. This is exactly where verification budgets collapse: we cannot verify the "from" because our attention is focused on the "to."
