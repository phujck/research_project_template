# Abstract
In 2024, NHGRI-funded genomic resource projects completed a Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) and interviews to evaluate their application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and sustainability. Key challenges were identified in metadata tools, data curation, variant identifiers, and data processing. Addressing these needs, we engaged the community through webinars and discussions, leading to a two-day workshop in March 2025. The workshop developed targeted recommendations, including improving transparency, standardizing identifiers, enhancing usability, implementing APIs, leveraging AI/ML for curation, and evaluating impact. These outcomes provide a framework for advancing FAIR practices, fostering collaboration, and strengthening the sustainability of NHGRI resources.
