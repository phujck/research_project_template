# Manuscript Structure: The Fragility of Obviousness

## 0. Meta-Information
*   **Tone**: Pedagogical, Wry, Recursive. "The Zero-Credit Theorem".
*   **Format**: **RevTeX 4-2** (APS, PRL/PRA, Reprint style).
*   **Compilation**: Success (`manuscript/build_v2/main.pdf`).
*   **Status**: DRAFT 2.3 (Runge Integration & Construction Cost Theory).

## 1. Abstract [Done]
*   **Core Hook**: Recursive Irony. Maximizing obviousness to increase rejection probability.

## 2. Introduction [Done]
*   **Hook**: Clarity = Efficiency = Blindness.
*   **Thesis**: $O_R(P)$ is a metric of efficiency, not truth.

## 3. Methods (The Thermodynamics of Obviousness) [Expanded & Cited]
*   **Formalization**: Obviousness $O_R(P) = 1/C_{ver}$.
*   **Simulation 1 (Discrete)**: Sparse Parity (Decision Trees).
*   **Simulation 2 (Continuous)**: The Runge Cliff (Polynomial Regression).
    *   **The Trap**: High-Obviousness models (lines) miss the "Cliff" at $x=0.98$.
    *   **Mechanism**: **Construction Cost**. Agents default to "Standard Toolkit" (Polynomials) to avoid the cost of searching for custom bases (Wavelets).

## 4. Results [Done]
*   **Fragility Continuum (Logic)**: Phase transition in Decision Trees.
*   **Runge Fits (Calculus)**: Visual confirmation of Spectral Blindness.
*   **Figures**: `fragility_curve.pdf`, `runge_fits.pdf`, `continuous_fragility.pdf`.

## 5. Discussion [Done]
*   **Interpretation**: Efficiency mandates Blindness.
*   **Construction Cost**: Explicit alignment with the core principle ($O = 1/C$).
*   **recursive Conclusion**: "The only rational response to this paper is to doubt it."
